# Learning Probability Density Functions using Roll-Number-Parameterized Non-Linear Model

## Overview

This project focuses on estimating the parameters of a probability
density function (PDF) after applying a non-linear transformation to air
quality data. The Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) concentration values are used
as the primary feature, and a roll-number-based transformation is
applied to generate a new variable. The transformed data is then modeled
using a Gaussian-like probability density function to learn its
parameters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains air quality measurements collected from monitoring
stations. Among multiple pollutants available in the dataset, **NO₂
(Nitrogen Dioxide)** was selected as the feature **x** for this
assignment.

Before performing statistical computations, minimal preprocessing was
applied to ensure data validity without altering the natural
distribution.

The preprocessing steps included converting NO₂ values into numeric
format, removing missing values (NaN), filtering out invalid negative
readings, and converting the cleaned values into a NumPy array for
efficient computation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Roll Number Details

**Roll No. (here 102317229)** was used to compute the transformation
constants as required in the assignment.

The transformation parameters are defined as:

aᵣ = 0.05 × (r mod 7)\
bᵣ = 0.3 × ((r mod 5) + 1)

For **Roll No. (here 102317229)**:

-   r mod 7 = 0
-   r mod 5 = 4

Therefore,

aᵣ = 0.05 × 0 = **0.0**\
bᵣ = 0.3 × 5 = **1.5**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methodology

### Step 1: Non-Linear Transformation

Each NO₂ observation **x** is transformed into a new variable **z**
using the function:

z = Tᵣ(x) = x + aᵣ sin(bᵣ x)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 2: Probability Density Function Modeling

The transformed variable **z** is modeled using the following
probability density function:

p̂(z) = c · exp(−λ(z − μ)²)

This equation represents a Gaussian-like distribution where:

-   **μ (mu)** represents the mean of the transformed data.
-   **λ (lambda)** controls the spread of the distribution and is
    inversely related to variance.
-   **c** is the normalization constant ensuring that the total
    probability integrates to one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Parameter Estimation

The parameters were estimated directly from the transformed dataset
using statistical moments.

The mean was computed as the average of all transformed observations.
Variance was calculated to measure the spread of the data around the
mean.

Mathematically,

μ = (1/N) Σ zᵢ

σ² = (1/N) Σ (zᵢ − μ)²

λ = 1 / (2σ²)

c = √(λ / π)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Result Table

The estimated parameters are automatically generated by the code and
stored in:

**outputs/estimated_parameters.csv**

The table contains:

-   Roll number (here 102317229)
-   Transformation constants (aᵣ and bᵣ)
-   Estimated μ
-   Estimated λ
-   Estimated c
-   Total number of samples used

These parameters define the learned probability density function for the
transformed variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Result Graph

The project generates a visualization that combines both empirical data
and the learned model.

The histogram represents the actual distribution of the transformed
variable **z**, while the smooth curve plotted over it represents the
estimated probability density function.

If the curve closely follows the shape of the histogram, it indicates
that the learned parameters successfully capture the statistical
behavior of the data.

The graph is saved as:

**outputs/fit_plot.png**

## Interpretation of Results

The transformed dataset exhibits an approximately bell-shaped
distribution, suggesting that the Gaussian-like model is appropriate for
representing the data.
